                    The highlight of the week-long events is an observation of the 100-year mark of the devastation resulting from the East St. Louis riots. It is slated for 7 p.m. Monday, Jan. 23, in the Mildred E. Bastian Center for the Performing Arts. The program will feature a historical perspective, art exhibits and musical selections to heighten public awareness and to honor the ancestors who died and survived the 1917 pogrom. Two members of the 1917 Centennial Commission will be the featured speakers. They are Eugene B. Redmond, poet laureate of East St. Louis and emeritus professor of English at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, and Karla Scott, associate professor of communication and director of the African-American Studies program at Saint Louis University. True Light Baptist Church will provide a musical tribute.
